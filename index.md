# Hey there!
{: .fs-9 }

Welcome to my corner of the web. This is where I showcase my portfolio projects and blog some interesting stuff.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

I'm currently switching my domain from a more verbose bharatsaya.com to this one because it's only five letters and since I'm into .net stack, I felt it would make more sense for my use case to go with a .net domain instead of the more common .com domain extension. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

So, this is work in progress, but shouldn't take too long either. Check back after a week or so? If you're in too much of an hurry, you can always reach me at mail@bsaya.net
